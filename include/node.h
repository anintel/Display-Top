/**
 * @struct Node
 * @brief Represents a node in a tree structure.
 * 
 * This structure is used to represent a node in a tree, where each node can have a name,
 * a display function, a parent node, and an array of child nodes.
 * 
 * @var Node::name
 * A character array to store the name of the node. The name can be up to 49 characters long,
 * with the 50th character reserved for the null terminator.
 * 
 * @var Node::displayFunction
 * A pointer to a function that takes a WINDOW pointer and a variable number of arguments,
 * and returns an integer. This function is used to display the node.
 * 
 * @var Node::parent
 * A pointer to the parent node. If the node is the root, this will be NULL.
 * 
 * @var Node::children
 * A pointer to an array of child nodes. If the node has no children, this will be NULL.
 * 
 * @var Node::childrenSize
 * An integer representing the number of children the node has.
